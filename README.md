# PyBer Ride-Share Data Analysis

Data analysis project using Python, Pandas and Matplotlib to analyze ride-sharing data related to different city types.
 
## Overview of Project

In this project, we created a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type using Pyton and Pandas. With these same tools and the use of Matplotlib, a multiple line graph that shows the total weekly fares por each city type was made.


### Purpose

The purpose of the analysis is to provide data driven insight related to city types, so it can be used by decision makers at Pyber.


## Results

The analysis shows that there are two city types that are decreasing in their fares, Urban and Rural. The Suburban type of city that was doing well, increasing and near its heights. 

We can see that the Rural type of cities had the fewest rides with 125 and the least drivers with 78. But the Average Fare per Ride of $34.62 and the Average Fare per Driver of $55.49 were the highest. 

The most rides and drivers were in the Urban cities with 1,625 rides and 2,405 drivers. But the Average Fare per Ride of $24.53 and the Average Fare per Driver of $16.57 were the lowest.

As it can be inferred, and is shown in the following table, the Suburban type of cities ranked in the middle. 
We can see in the following table ride-sharing data that includes the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type

## Summary

Considering there is unsatisfied demand in the Rural type of city, it could be a good strategy to get a few more drivers there, since each driver is very productive. Having 78 drivers in total, and an Average Fare per Driver of $55.49.

Next allocate drivers to the Urban cities because the fares there have decreased from its high.

The suburban type of city is going well, the recommendation here would be to keep doing things the same way. It is going up and near its highest point in fares.

### Final Consideration 

It would be important to analyze why the Average Fare per Driver in the Urban cities dropped more than in the Average Fare per Ride.
